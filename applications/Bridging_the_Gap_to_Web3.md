## Summary

“Bridging the Gap to Web3” is a monthly, global webinar series powered by the largest startup community in the world, [Startup Grind](https://www.startupgrind.com/) (5 million members, 650 chapters, in 140 countries). Each event explores how the Fourth Industrial Revolution is facilitating the next wave of innovation within specific industries. Our goal is to create a collaborative learning experience by bringing together Web2 and Web3 leaders to discuss specific topics related to their respective industries. These events are grounded in real-world application and permit not only practical education but immediate, actionable insights. Through these collaborative experiences, we strive to learn how we can implement new advancements not only into our business practices but also to employ their practical application into daily life.

Our inaugural episode aired on March 15th, 2022, in which Tyler Doussan, Chief Partnership Officer of Safe Haven, and Dave Gee, 4x startup founder and 3x Amazon best-selling author, discussed at a high-level the Fourth Industrial Revolution, setting the stage for the remainder of the series.

For our next event, on April 26th, 2022, we are bringing together Dimitris Neocleous, UK & EU Ecosystem Manager of VeChain Europe, and David Gielan, 4x startup founder and marketing expert, to discuss navigating marketing hype to better understand the real-world utility behind Web3 technology.

Following our April 26th episode, we intend to bring together a leader in the vNFT ecosystem alongside a comparable Web2 leader, to discuss the similarities and differences in how each have built / maintained their engaged communities and have developed strategies for rewarding the early adopters, as well as how early adopters have helped propel their business forward.

We desire VeChain grant funding to expand our resources, allowing us to amplify our powerful message to motivated individuals who are eager to learn about utilizing Web3 technology.

### Main field of research

Select the research field out of the 9 fields listed below or state &quot;others&quot;.

**Others**: Web 3 Thought-Leadership & Education

### Keywords

Web3, Startups, Education, Innovation, Blockchain

## Research proposal

### Problem Statement

In reflecting on the VeChain Whitepaper, it states “to achieve and fully harness this [blockchain] technology that will enable mass public adoption, we [VeChain] have identified three major phases of blockchain evolvement – Technical Consensus, Business Consensus, and Governance Consensus.” With recent regulatory news (i.e., European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets(MiCA)), we are confident we are close to achieving Governance Consensus. We understand that skepticism towards blockchain will be solved by pursuit for, and dissemination of, Education.

### Contributions

To our knowledge, our web series is the first contribution to the ecosystem that is bringing Web2 and Web3 speakers together to discuss real-world utility of Web3 technologies during this crucial turning point in technological and economic advancement.

### Approach

There is a new wave of innovation and disruptive technology that is changing the world, in ways that we can’t fully comprehend yet. Therefore, we constructed a monthly, live webinar series called “Bridging the Gap to Web3”, hosted by the world’s largest startup community, Startup Grind. Our goal is to bring together leaders who are changing the world through their creation of service and product offerings. Each episode provides two new speakers a platform to share their stories and discuss with one another from two sides of this ‘bridge’ that exists between Web2 and Web3. The agenda features a deep dive into specific topics relevant to our guests’ respective backgrounds and industries of focus, and the conversation will be moderated and facilitated by two members of Atlantis Capital.

Each episode will be a live event that encourages collaboration and networking amongst the audience to build working relationships and strengthens community. The events are recorded and are to be shared with the global Startup Grind community via YouTube. To help increase registration numbers and YouTube views, we have partnered with a brand strategy and marketing agency, Dominant Creative, to help develop appropriate assets and promote the web series. 

Our team will focus the resources this grant provides on our second episode with Dimitris, as well as our third episode featuring a prominent vNFT leader, allowing us to promote the episode not only to the VeChain community but also the greater blockchain community. With this grant, we will be able to amplify the episode's message to a larger audience, affording us the opportunity to inform viewers about adoption and utilization of Web3 technology into our everyday lives.

### Risks

There are no major risks associated with this proposal.

## Milestones

There are multiple parties involved including Atlantis Capital, Startup Grind, and Dominant Creative. We expect the project to span 6-8 weeks, centered around the following core tenants:

1. Marketing Strategy

2. Advertising Spend

    Once strategy has been developed and assets generated, Dominant Creative will help us create paid social media marketing campaigns to target audiences outside of       our personal networks and speakers’ connections.
  
    Cost: $15,000
